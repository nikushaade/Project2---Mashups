		<p> 5 years ago our team was wondering what would happen if we could Visualize music? It is something we hear, but we can not see. We decided to be the creators and the future and worked hard to bring you Soundization.</p>

		<p> Nothing Complicated, just looking at your favorite soundtracks with the help of music bars. Our partners at SoundCloud loved our idea and decided to partner with us. After several meetings and several years of production we are live. Use our website to listen to your favorite music, project the waves on the wall, enjoy the colors and most importantly don't limit yourself to just listening. </p>
